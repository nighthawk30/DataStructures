The first challenge I encountered was honestly understanding what was going on. I had to start with making a win/tie
check function to give myself time to think about it. It seemed pretty obvious that we were supposed to use sets to
guarantee uniqueness and sorted order. After that, the only problem I encountered was thinking that there were only 8
spots on a tic tac toe board.

The assignment was interesting because I had to think of a creative way to meet the criteria, but it was not a very
difficult application of recursion. I didn't like that there was no real way to check if the output of your program was
correct, it just calculated some numbers and board states
